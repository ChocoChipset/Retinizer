Retinizer
=========


## What exactly it does? 
Given a directory path:

1. Will find all "PNG" and "JPG" files in it and, if needed, will add a '@2x' suffix to those filenames.
1. Will write half resolution version of those files. New image files will be named after the original filenames but removing the '@2x' suffix.

## Usage 
1. Install the __RMagick__ gem.
1. Execute Retinizer script. First argument is the directory to operate. If no argument is supplied, operations will take place in current directory. 
1. Enjoy Retina and standard resolutions for your iOS projects. :Fuck Yeah:
